          The Room Rental System is a web application designed to streamline the
          process of finding and renting rooms, offering a user-friendly
          interface for both property owners and potential tenants. Built using
          React.js and Tailwind CSS, it features an intuitive design that
          showcases available rooms with key details like location, type, and

          system is optimized for a seamless experience, providing advanced
          filtering options and secure login features to enhance user
          interaction and satisfaction.
